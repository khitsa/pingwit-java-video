              Sometimes I just feel like gyittin', I still might

              Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
              Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
              And show these people what my level of skill's like
              But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
              Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights Case of the stage fright, goawin' a blank like

              So I must then get off the bus then split
              Man, fuck this shit, vo, I'm goin' the fuck home
              World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
